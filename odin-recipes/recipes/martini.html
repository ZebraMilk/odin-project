  <h1>The Martini</h1>

  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>The Martini has a nebulous original recipe, but undoubtedly not arriving in bartender's lexicons before that magical french vermouth in the mid-1800s.
    This drink requires that you care for your vermouth like the wine on which it is based: keep it cold, drink it within a few weeks.
    Folks often have an aversion to vermouth, wrinkling their nose at the word, but be assured, dear reader, that vermouth is a magical ingredient.
    The distaste is warranted, as drinking vermouth from a dusty bottle on a backbar is like drinking syrupy, bitter vinegar.
    Vermouth is a cocktail unto itself, however, containing sugar, herbs, brandy, and wine.
    Don't be scared of using more vermouth than seems necessary. The recipe is oft inverted, with more vermouth than Gin, even.
