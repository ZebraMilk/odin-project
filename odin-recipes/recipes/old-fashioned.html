  <h1>Old Fashioned Cocktails</h1>
  <img src="../images/old-fashioned.jpeg" alt="The way folks drank in the 1800s">
  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>Before the advent of refrigeration and the easier access to ice that railway systems provided, drinks were fairly simple.
    Bartenders were fond of mixing a little sugar and some bitters with a base spirit, and in the early 1800s, this spirit was most likely genever or rum.
    Whiskey didn't become America's sweetheart spirit until later in our drinking history.
    After the arrival of fancy European ingredients like fruit liqueuers and other aromatized wine-based concoctions, drinking became more complicated.
    By the Golden Age, after the American Civil War but before prohibition reared her dogmatic head, some folks just wanted that classic spirit-bitters-sugar.
    To distinguish these cocktails from the "fancy" drinks bartenders were want to make, they would order a cocktail, the old-fashioned way.
    Skip ahead to the latter 20th century, and a similar renaissance occurs.
    The Old Fashioned had become a thing of muddled fruit, sweet cherries, regional variations included sour mix or sparkling water, and the spirits used were almost alwasy brandy or bourbon.
    Bar folk of all sorts 'rediscovered' the old-fashioned cocktail, and it can be applied to <em>any</em> spirit.
