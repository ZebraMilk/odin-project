    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>The Rickey is one of the most refreshing drinks, arriving at a time when ice was just beginning to make its way into hotels and saloons across the country.
      Most often served with a clear spirit like Gin or Vodka, you can use this recipe to make any spirit refreshing. 
      This drink is wildly refreshing, not containing any sugar in its original for, just a bracing cold, fizzy 
      One key to its magnificence is the addition of saline solution, mimicking the non-neutral sparkling water of generations ago.
